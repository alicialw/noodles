                    <h2>The Project</h2>
                    <p>Instant noodles exist in a cultural contradiction - beloved comfort food yet stigmatized in health-conscious conversations. This creates unnecessary guilt around a food that offers legitimate psychological benefits beyond nutrition.</p>
                    
                    <p>Noodles & Beyond examines this contradiction through cultural probes and visualization, revealing how people personalize their noodle experience through toppings (as self-care) and integrate it into meaningful activities. Data came from cultural probes - a research method designed to feel more like a game than a formal study.</p>
                    
                    <p>By visualizing the overlooked emotional aspects of our food relationships, this project validates comfort eating while sparking discussion about balancing physical and emotional nourishment in our increasingly quantified food culture.</p>

                    <h2>Comfort food, but why instant noodles?</h2>
                    <p>This project started from a speculative angle. I chose instant noodles as my theme because they intersect with contemporary concerns about cuisine, fitness, and lifestyle.</p>
                    
                    <p>Instant noodles are affordable, convenient, and honestly, addictive. You can customize them with endless toppings, get them in countless flavors, soupy or stir-fried. They've become a staple across Asian cuisines, especially in East and Southeast Asia, even becoming part of daily eating habits in countries like South Korea.</p>
                    
                    <p>Vietnamese people today have amazing access to fresh ingredients and street food everywhere. Markets overflow with vegetables, herbs, and proteins for traditional cooking. Yet instant noodle consumption here remains incredibly high, among the world's highest. This contradiction reflects our changing lifestyles: urban living, longer work hours, and more people living alone create situations where convenience beats tradition. These small noodle packets fill gaps between proper meals, not replacing traditional cooking but creating their own category that adapts to modern needs while maintaining cultural connections through familiar ingredients.</p>
                    
                    <p>We Gen Z exist in this weird paradox - we're obsessed with health yet consume more processed convenience foods than anyone. Some friends track macros religiously while others wait for their instant noodles to cook. I remember adding an egg to midnight ramen while my friends discussed clean eating in our group chat. It's not hypocrisy but adaptation to modern pressures: limited time, tight budgets, and the emotional comfort these foods provide during stressful times. The humble noodle bowl becomes both a guilty pleasure and a necessary emotional support - something our fitness apps completely fail to measure.</p>

                    <h2>Cultural probe as a qualitative research and ideation method</h2>
                    <p>Coming from the User Experience stream of my Year 2, I intentionally avoided the typical survey style with statistical graphs and user personas. Cultural probes allowed me to approach this project with the novelty and creative freedom, combining seemingly ordinary activities like drawing and photography with playful elements. Rather than treating participants as data points, the probe invited them into the creative process, transforming research into a collaborative experience that produced rich, unexpected insights no survey could capture.</p>
                    
                    <p>Each probe component was actually my unconscious attempt to channel my curiosity and expectations into the project. The memory vessel drawing task wasn't planned but began as an intuitive exploration that surprisingly revealed fascinating emotional codes in participants' language choices. The "accidental art" of food splashes was just a playful experiment that unexpectedly became one of the most authentic documentation methods. Not every data point ended up in the final visualization. Still, each element contributed to the evolving narrative, like ingredients in a complex broth, some subtle but all essential to the final flavor. The experience of completing the probe itself became part of the project's commentary on how we engage with food: thoughtful, messy, emotionally charged, and impossible to fully quantify.</p>

                    <h2>Data visualization as the main deliverable</h2>
                    <p>I am particularly drawn to data visualization as the meeting point between analytical thinking and creative expression. Although this project originated in a speculative theme, it naturally evolved into storytelling through data visualization, where patterns of human behavior become visible without reducing people to statistics. Creating these visualizations allowed me to transform qualitative insights into visual poetry that speaks to both emotional and intellectual understanding. The data garden approach doesn't just show findings; it creates an experience that mirrors the comfort food ritualsâ€”organic, evolving, and deeply personal, while revealing surprising commonalities across different people's experiences.</p>
